      <li>Blockchain</li>
      <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p>The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like, <i><b>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and React Native,</b></i>while introducing the students to development of Microservices and Software development techniques on cloud platform like AWS</p>
    <h2>ARTIFICIAL Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b>Python,</b> <b>Numpy,</b> <b>Pandas</b> <b>Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</b> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h2>Blockchain</h2>
    <p>
      The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the Blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript and on frameworks like Node.js.The Program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps(DApps),frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-Service(BaaS) and how to develop and offer an intial Coin Offering(ICO) of crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h2>Internet Of Things:</h2>
    <p>
      The<b> Internet of Things</b> program introduces the students to open source development technologies like <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</i></b> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control
